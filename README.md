# Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my deep learning repository! This marks the beginning of my educational experience in neural networks and machine learning. I will be documenting my progress, experiments, and key learnings along the way.

## Learning Path
One of the fundamental concepts in deep learning is the distinction between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

### **Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the correct output. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs.

ðŸ”¹ Examples of neural networks I will explore:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** (for image recognition)
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** (for sequential data like text and time series)

### **Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to find hidden patterns, groupings, or representations in the data without explicit guidance.

ðŸ”¹ Examples of neural networks I will explore:
- **Autoencoders** (for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection)
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** (for generating new data)
- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)** (for clustering and visualization)

## Goals
- Build and train neural networks from scratch using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
- Work on real-world datasets to solidify my understanding
- Explore advanced architectures and fine-tune models

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
